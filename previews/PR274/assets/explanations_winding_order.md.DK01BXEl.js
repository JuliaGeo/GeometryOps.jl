However, most algorithms are agnostic to winding order, and instead rely on the GeoInterface <code>getexterior</code> and <code>gethole</code> functions to distinguish holes from exteriors. Notably, <em>most</em> GIS implementations agree that polygons can have only one exterior but several holes.</p><h2 id="What-other-libraries-do" tabindex="-1">What other libraries do <a class="header-anchor" href="#What-other-libraries-do" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What other libraries do {#What-other-libraries-do}&quot;">​</a></h2><p>TODO: Markdown table with a bunch of libraries/standards, their winding orders, and references.</p>',6)]))}const f=r(n,[["render",t]]);export{p as __pageData,f as default};
