This function is different for intersection, difference, and union. fstep must take in two arguments: the most recent intersection node's entry/exit status and a boolean that is true if we are currently tracing alist and false if we are tracing b_list. The functions used for each clipping operation are follows:     - Intersection: (x, y) -> x ? 1 : (-1)     - Difference: (x, y) -> (x ⊻ y) ? 1 : (-1)     - Union: (x, y) -> (x ⊻ y) ? 1 : (-1)","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"A list of GeoInterface polygons is returned from this function.","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"function _trace_polynodes(::Type{T}, a_list, b_list, a_idx_list, f_step) where T\n    n_a_pts, n_b_pts = length(a_list), length(b_list)\n    n_intr_pts = length(a_idx_list)\n    return_polys = Vector{_get_poly_type(T)}(undef, 0)","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"Keep track of number of processed intersection points","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"    processed_pts = 0\n    while processed_pts < n_intr_pts\n        curr_list, curr_npoints = a_list, n_a_pts\n        on_a_list = true","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"Find first unprocessed intersecting point in subject polygon","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"        processed_pts += 1\n        first_idx = findnext(x -> x != 0, a_idx_list, processed_pts)\n        idx = a_idx_list[first_idx]\n        a_idx_list[first_idx] = 0\n        start_pt = a_list[idx]","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"Set first point in polygon","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"        curr = curr_list[idx]\n        pt_list = [curr.point]\n\n        curr_not_start = true\n        while curr_not_start\n            step = f_step(curr.ent_exit, on_a_list)\n            curr_not_intr = true\n            while curr_not_intr","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"Traverse polygon either forwards or backwards","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"                idx += step\n                idx = (idx > curr_npoints) ? mod(idx, curr_npoints) : idx\n                idx = (idx == 0) ? curr_npoints : idx","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"Get current node and add to pt_list","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"                curr = curr_list[idx]\n                push!(pt_list, curr.point)\n                if curr.inter","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"Keep track of processed intersection points","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"                    curr_not_start = curr != start_pt && curr != b_list[start_pt.neighbor]\n                    if curr_not_start\n                        processed_pts += 1\n                        a_idx_list[curr.idx] = 0\n                    end\n                    curr_not_intr = false\n                end\n            end","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"Switch to next list and next point","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/clipping/clipping_processor/","page":"Polygon clipping helpers","title":"Polygon clipping helpers","text":"            curr_list, curr_npoints = on_a_list ?
