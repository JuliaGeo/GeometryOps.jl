The winding order also doesn't have to be the same to represent the same geometry. This requires checking every point against every other point in the two geometries we are comparing. Also, some geometries must be \"closed\" like polygons and linear rings. These will be assumed to be closed, even if they don't have a repeated last point explicity written in the coordinates. Additionally, geometries and multi-geometries can be equal if the multi-geometry only includes that single geometry.","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/equals/","page":"Equals","title":"Equals","text":"\"\"\"\n    equals(geom1, geom2)::Bool\n\nCompare two Geometries return true if they are the same geometry.\n\n# Examples\n```jldoctest\nimport GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI\npoly1 = GI.Polygon([[(0,0), (0,5), (5,5), (5,0), (0,0)]])\npoly2 = GI.Polygon([[(0,0), (0,5), (5,5), (5,0), (0,0)]])\n\nGO.equals(poly1, poly2)","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/equals/","page":"Equals","title":"Equals","text":"output","category":"page"},{"location":"source/methods/equals/","page":"Equals","title":"Equals","text":"true\n```\n\"\"\"\nequals(geom_a, geom_b) = equals(\n    GI.trait(geom_a), geom_a,\n    GI.trait(geom_b), geom_b,\n)\n\n\"\"\"\n    equals(::T, geom_a, ::T, geom_b)::Bool\n\nTwo geometries of the same type, which don't have a equals function to dispatch\noff of should throw an error.\n\"\"\"\nequals(::T, geom_a, ::T, geom_b) where T = error(\"Cant compare $T yet\")\n\n\"\"\"\n    equals(trait_a, geom_a, trait_b, geom_b)\n\nTwo geometries which are not of the same type cannot be equal so they always\nreturn false.\n\"\"\"\nequals(trait_a, geom_a, trait_b, geom_b) = false\n\n\"\"\"\n    equals(::GI.PointTrait, p1, ::GI.PointTrait, p2)::Bool\n\nTwo points are the same if they have the same x and y (and z if 3D) coordinates.\n\"\"\"\nfunction equals(::GI.PointTrait, p1, ::GI.PointTrait, p2)\n    GI.ncoord(p1) == GI.ncoord(p2) || return false\n    GI.x(p1) == GI.x(p2) || return false\n    GI.y(p1) == GI.y(p2) || return false\n    if GI.is3d(p1)\n        GI.z(p1) == GI.z(p2) || return false\n    end\n    return true\nend\n\n\"\"\"\n    equals(::GI.PointTrait, p1, ::GI.MultiPointTrait, mp2)::Bool\n\nA point and a multipoint are equal if the multipoint is composed of a single\npoint that is equivalent to the given point.\n\"\"\"\nfunction equals(::GI.PointTrait, p1, ::GI.MultiPointTrait, mp2)\n    GI.npoint(mp2) == 1 || return false\n    return equals(p1, GI.getpoint(mp2, 1))\nend\n\n\"\"\"\n    equals(::GI.MultiPointTrait, mp1, ::GI.PointTrait, p2)::Bool\n\nA point and a multipoint are equal if the multipoint is composed of a single\npoint that is equivalent to the given point.\n\"\"\"\nequals(trait1::GI.MultiPointTrait, mp1, trait2::GI.PointTrait, p2) =\n    equals(trait2, p2, trait1, mp1)\n\n\"\"\"\n    equals(::GI.MultiPointTrait, mp1, ::GI.MultiPointTrait, mp2)::Bool\n\nTwo multipoints are equal if they share the same set of points.\n\"\"\"\nfunction equals(::GI.MultiPointTrait, mp1, ::GI.MultiPointTrait, mp2)\n    GI.npoint(mp1) == GI.npoint(mp2) || return false\n    for p1 in GI.getpoint(mp1)\n        has_match = false  # if point has a matching point in other multipoint\n        for p2 in GI.getpoint(mp2)\n            if equals(p1, p2)\n                has_match = true\n                break\n            end\n        end\n        has_match || return false  # if no matching point, can't be equal\n    end\n    return true  # all points had a match\nend\n\n\"\"\"\n    _equals_curves(c1, c2, closed_type1, closed_type2)::Bool\n\nTwo curves are equal if they share the same set of point, representing the same\ngeometry.
