# # `apply`

export apply

#=

This file mainly defines the [`apply`](@ref) function.

In general, the idea behind the `apply` framework is to take 
as input any geometry, vector of geometries, or feature collection,
deconstruct it to the given trait target (any arbitrary GI.AbstractTrait 
or `TraitTarget` union thereof, like `PointTrait` or `PolygonTrait`) 
and perform some operation on it.  Then, the geometry or structure is rebuilt.

This allows for a simple and consistent framework within which users can 
define their own operations trivially easily, and removes a lot of the 
complexity involved with handling complex geometry structures.

For example, a simple way to flip the x and y coordinates of a geometry is:

```julia
flipped_geom = GO.apply(GI.PointTrait(), geom) do p
    (GI.y(p), GI.x(p))
end
```

As simple as that.  There's no need to implement your own decomposition because it's done for you.

Functions like [`flip`](@ref), [`reproject`](@ref), [`transform`](@ref), even [`segmentize`](@ref) and [`simplify`](@ref) have been implemented
using the `apply` framework.  Similarly, [`centroid`](@ref), [`area`](@ref) and [`distance`](@ref) have been implemented using the 
[`applyreduce`](@ref) framework.

## What is `apply`?

`apply` applies some function to every geometry matching the `Target`
GeoInterface trait, in some arbitrarily nested object made up of:
- `AbstractArray`s (we also try to iterate other non-GeoInteface compatible object)
- `FeatureCollectionTrait` objects
- `FeatureTrait` objects
- `AbstractGeometryTrait` objects

`apply` recursively calls itself through these nested
layers until it reaches objects with the `Target` GeoInterface trait. When found `apply` applies the function `f`, and stops.

The outer recursive functions then progressively rebuild the object
using GeoInterface objects matching the original traits.

If `PointTrait` is found  but it is not the `Target`, an error is thrown.
This likely means the object contains a different geometry trait to
the target, such as `MultiPointTrait` when `LineStringTrait` was specified.

To handle this possibility it may be necessary to make `Target` a
`Union` of traits found at the same level of nesting, and define methods
of `f` to handle all cases.

Be careful making a union across "levels" of nesting, e.g.
`Union{FeatureTrait,PolygonTrait}`, as `_apply` will just never reach
`PolygonTrait` when all the polygons are wrapped in a `FeatureTrait` object.

### Embedding

`extent` and `crs` can be embedded in all geometries, features, and
feature collections as part of `apply`. Geometries deeper than `Target`
will of course not have new `extent` or `crs` embedded.

- `calc_extent` signals to recalculate an `Extent` and embed it.
- `crs` will be embedded as-is

### Threading

Threading is used at the outermost level possible - over
an array, feature collection, or e.g. a MultiPolygonTrait where
each `PolygonTrait` sub-geometry may be calculated on a different thread.

Currently, threading defaults to `false` for all objects, but can be turned on
by passing the keyword argument `threaded=true` to `apply`.

Threading uses [StableTasks.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds2/StableTasks.jl) to provide
type-stable tasks (base Julia `Threads.@spawn` is not type stable).  This is completely cost-free
and saves some allocations when running multithreaded. 

The current strategy is to launch 2 tasks for each CPU thread, to provide load balancing.  We
assume Julia will manage these tasks efficiently, and we don't want to run too many tasks
since each task does have some overhead when it's created.  This may need revisiting in the future,
but it's a pretty easy heuristic to use.

## Implementation

Literate.jl source code is below.

***

=#

"""
    apply(f, target::Union{TraitTarget, GI.AbstractTrait}, obj; kw...)

Reconstruct a geometry, feature, feature collection, or nested vectors of
either using the function `f` on the `target` trait.

`f(target_geom) => x` where `x` also has the `target` trait, or a trait that can
be substituted. For example, swapping `PolgonTrait` to `MultiPointTrait` will fail
if the outer object has `MultiPolygonTrait`, but should work if it has `FeatureTrait`.

Objects "shallower" than the target trait are always completely rebuilt, like
a `Vector` of `FeatureCollectionTrait` of `FeatureTrait` when the target
has `PolygonTrait` and is held in the features. These will always be GeoInterface 
geometries/feature/feature collections. But "deeper" objects may remain
unchanged or be whatever GeoInterface compatible objects `f` returns.

The result is a functionally similar geometry with values depending on `f`.

## Example

Flipped point the order in any feature or geometry, or iterables of either:

```julia
import GeoInterface as GI
import GeometryOps as GO
geom = GI.Polygon([GI.LinearRing([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (1, 2)]),
                   GI.LinearRing([(3, 4), (5, 6), (6, 7), (3, 4)])])

flipped_geom = GO.apply(GI.PointTrait, geom) do p
    (GI.y(p), GI.x(p))
end
```

Doing this inline in `_apply` is _heavily_ type unstable, so it's best to separate this 
by a function barrier.

This function operates `apply` on the `geometry` column of the table, and returns a new table
with the same schema, but with the new geometry column.

This new table may be of the same type as the old one iff `Tables.materializer` is defined for 
that table.  If not, then a `NamedTuple` is returned.

    new_geometry = _apply(f, target, Tables.getcolumn(iterable, geometry_column); threaded, kw...)

    # or a named tuple which is the default fallback.

### `_maptasks` - flexible, threaded `map`

using Base.Threads: nthreads, @threads, @spawn

#=
Here we used to use the compiler directive `@assume_effects :foldable` to force the compiler
to lookup through the closure. This alone makes e.g. `flip` 2.5x faster!

But it caused inference to fail, so we've removed it.  No effect on runtime so far as we can tell, 
at least in Julia 1.11.
