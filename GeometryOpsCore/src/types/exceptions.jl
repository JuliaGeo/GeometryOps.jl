# Errors and exceptions

We create a few custom exception types in this file,
that have nice show methods that we can use for certain errors.

This makes it substantially easier to catch specific kinds of errors and show them.
For example, we can catch `WrongManifoldException` and show a nice error message,
and error hinters can be specialized to that as well.

We also have a custom error type for missing keywords in an algorithm,
which could eventually be extended to have typo detection, et cetera.

"""
    MissingKeywordInAlgorithmException{Alg, F} <: Exception

An error type which is thrown when a keyword argument is missing from an algorithm.

The `alg` argument is the algorithm struct, and the `keyword` argument is the keyword
that was missing.

This error message is used in the [`enforce`](@ref GeometryOps.enforce) method.

## Usage

This is of course not how you would actually use this error type, but it is
how you construct and throw it.

```julia
throw(MissingKeywordInAlgorithmException(GEOS(; tokl = 1.0), my_function, :tol))
```

Real world usage will often look like this:

```julia
function my_function(alg::CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm, args...)
    mykwarg = enforce(alg, :mykwarg, my_function) # this will throw an error if :mykwarg is not present in alg
end
```

    keyword::Symbol
