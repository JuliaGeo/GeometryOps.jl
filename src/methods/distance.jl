## What is distance? What is signed distance?

Distance is the distance of a point to another geometry. This is always a
positive number. If a point is inside of geometry, so on a curve or inside of a
polygon, the distance will be zero. Signed distance is mainly used for polygons
and multipolygons. If a point is outside of a geometry, signed distance has the
same value as distance. However, points within the geometry have a negative
distance representing the distance of a point to the closest boundary.
Therefore, for all "non-filled" geometries, like curves, the distance will
either be postitive or 0.

To provide an example, consider this rectangle:
```@example rect
using GeometryOps
using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
using Makie

rect = Polygon([Point(0,0), Point(0,1), Point(1,1), Point(1,0), Point(0, 0)])
point_in = Point(0.5, 0.5) 
point_out = Point(0.5, 1.5)
f, a, p = poly(rect; axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
scatter!(f, point_in)
scatter!(f, point_out)
f
```
This is clearly a rectangle with one point inside and one point outside. The
points are both an equal distance to the polygon. The distance to point_in is
negative while the distance to point_out is positive.
```@example rect
distance(point_in, poly)  # == 0
signed_distance(point_in, poly)  # < 0
signed_distance(point_out, poly)  # > 0
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation. First, we implement a
wrapper method that dispatches to the correct implementation based on the
geometry trait. This is also used in the implementation, since it's a lot less
work!

Distance and signed distance are only implemented for points to other geometries
right now. This could be extended to include distance from other geometries in
the future.

The distance calculated is the Euclidean distance using the Pythagorean theorem.
Also note that singed_distance only makes sense for "filled-in" shapes, like
polygons, so it isn't implemented for curves.

"""
    distance(point, geom)::Real

Calculates the  ditance from the geometry `g1` to the `point`. The distance
will always be positive or zero.

The method will differ based on the type of the geometry provided:
    - The distance from a point to a point is just the Euclidean distance
    between the points.
    - The distance from a point to a multipolygon is the shortest distance from
    a the given point to any point within the multipoint object.
    - The distance from a point to a line is the minimum distance from the point
    to the closest point on the given line.
    - The distance from a point to a linestring is the minimum distance from the
    point to the closest segment of the linestring.
    - The distance from a point to a linear ring is the minimum distance from
    the point to the closest segment of the linear ring.
    - The distance from a point to a polygon is zero if the point is within the
    polygon and otherwise is the minimum distance from the point to an edge of
    the polygon. This includes edges created by holes.
    - The distance from a point to a multipolygon is zero if the point is within
    the multipolygon and otherwise is the minimum distance from the point to the
    closest edge of any of the polygons within the multipolygon. This includes
    edges created by holes of the polygons as well.

    GI.trait(point), point,
    GI.trait(geom), geom,

"""
    signed_distance(point, geom)::Real

Calculates the signed distance from the geometry `geom` to the given point.
Points within `geom` have a negative signed distance, and points outside of
`geom` have a positive signed distance.
    - The signed distance from a point to a point, line, linestring, or linear
    ring is equal to the distance between the two.
    - The signed distance from a point to a polygon is negative if the point is
    within the polygon and is positive otherwise. The value of the distance is
    the minimum distance from the point to an edge of the polygon. This includes
    edges created by holes.
    - The signed distance from a point to a mulitpolygon is negative if the
    point is within one of the polygons that make up the multipolygon and is
    positive otherwise. The value of the distance is the minimum distance from
    the point to an edge of the multipolygon. This includes edges created by
    holes of the polygons as well.
