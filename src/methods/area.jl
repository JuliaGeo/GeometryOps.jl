## What is area? What is signed area?

Area is the amount of space occupied by a two-dimensional figure. It is always a positive
value. Signed area is simply the integral over the exterior path of a polygon, minus the sum
of integrals over its interior holes. It is signed such that a clockwise path has a positive
area, and a counterclockwise path has a negative area. The area is the absolute value of the
signed area.

To provide an example, consider this rectangle:
```@example rect
import GeometryOps as GO
import GeoInterface as GI
using Makie
using CairoMakie

rect = GI.Polygon([[(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0), (0, 0)]])
f, a, p = poly(collect(GI.getpoint(rect)); axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
```
This is clearly a rectangle, etc.  But now let's look at how the points look:
```@example rect
lines!(
    collect(GI.getpoint(rect));
    color = 1:GI.npoint(rect), linewidth = 10.0)
f
```
The points are ordered in a counterclockwise fashion, which means that the signed area
is negative.  If we reverse the order of the points, we get a postive area.
```@example rect
GO.signed_area(rect)  # -1.0
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation. First, we implement a wrapper method
that dispatches to the correct implementation based on the geometry trait. This is also used
in the implementation, since it's a lot less work!

Note that area and signed area are zero for all points and curves, even if the
curves are closed like with a linear ring. Also note that signed area really only makes
sense for polygons, given with a multipolygon can have several polygons each with a
different orientation and thus the absolute value of the signed area might not be the area.
This is why signed area is only implemented for polygons.

"""
    area(geom, [T = Float64])::T

Returns the area of a geometry or collection of geometries. 
This is computed slightly differently for different geometries:

    - The area of a point/multipoint is always zero.
    - The area of a curve/multicurve is always zero.
    - The area of a polygon is the absolute value of the signed area.
    - The area multi-polygon is the sum of the areas of all of the sub-polygons.
    - The area of a geometry collection, feature collection of array/iterable 
        is the sum of the areas of all of the sub-geometries. 

Result will be of type T, where T is an optional argument with a default value
of Float64.

    signed_area(geom, [T = Float64])::T

Returns the signed area of a single geometry, based on winding order. 
This is computed slighly differently for different geometries:

    - The signed area of a point is always zero.
    - The signed area of a curve is always zero.
    - The signed area of a polygon is computed with the shoelace formula and is
    positive if the polygon coordinates wind clockwise and negative if
    counterclockwise.
    - You cannot compute the signed area of a multipolygon as it doesn't have a
    meaning as each sub-polygon could have a different winding order.

Result will be of type T, where T is an optional argument with a default value
of Float64.
