## What is `intersects` vs `intersection` vs `intersection_points`?

The intersects function checks if a given geometry intersects with another
geometry, or in other words, the either the interiors or boundaries of the two
geometries intersect.

The `intersection` methods return the geometry intersection between the two
input geometries. The `intersection_points` method returns a list of
intersection points between two geometries.

The `intersects` methods will always return a Boolean. However, note that the
`intersection` methods will not all return the same type. For example, the
intersection of two lines will be a point in most cases, unless the lines are
parallel. On the other hand, the intersection of two polygons will be another
polygon in most cases. Finally, the `intersection_points` method returns a list
of tuple points.

To provide an example, consider these two lines:
```@example intersects_intersection
import GeometryOps as GO
import GeoInterface a GI
using Makie
using CairoMakie

line1 = GI.Line([(124.584961,-12.768946), (126.738281,-17.224758)])
line2 = GI.Line([(123.354492,-15.961329), (127.22168,-14.008696)])
f, a, p = lines(GI.getpoint(line1))
lines!(GI.getpoint(line2))
f
```
We can see that they intersect, so we expect intersects to return true, and we
can visualize the intersection point in red.
```@example intersects_intersection
GO.intersects(line1, line2)  # true
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

Given that intersects is the exact opposite of disjoint, we simply pass the two
inputs variables, swapped in order, to disjoint.
=#

"""
    intersects(geom1, geom2)::Bool

Return true if the interiors or boundaries of the two geometries interact.

`intersects` returns the exact opposite result of `disjoint`.

## Example

```jldoctest
import GeoInterface as GI, GeometryOps as GO

line1 = GI.Line([(124.584961,-12.768946), (126.738281,-17.224758)])
line2 = GI.Line([(123.354492,-15.961329), (127.22168,-14.008696)])
GO.intersects(line1, line2)

# output
true
```
"""
intersects(geom1, geom2) = !disjoint(geom1, geom2)


"""
    intersection(geom_a, geom_b)::Union{Tuple{::Real, ::Real}, ::Nothing}

Return an intersection point between two geometries. Return nothing if none are
found. Else, the return type depends on the input. It will be a union between:
a point, a line, a linear ring, a polygon, or a multipolygon

## Example

```jldoctest
import GeoInterface as GI, GeometryOps as GO

line1 = GI.Line([(124.584961,-12.768946), (126.738281,-17.224758)])
