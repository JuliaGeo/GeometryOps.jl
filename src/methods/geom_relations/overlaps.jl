## What is overlaps?

The overlaps function checks if two geometries overlap. Two geometries can only
overlap if they have the same dimension, and if they overlap, but one is not
contained, within, or equal to the other.

Note that this means it is impossible for a single point to overlap with a
single point and a line only overlaps with another line if only a section of
each line is colinear. 

To provide an example, consider these two lines:
```@example cshape
using GeometryOps
using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
using Makie
using CairoMakie

l1 = GI.LineString([(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 10.0)])
l2 = GI.LineString([(0.0, -10.0), (0.0, 3.0)])
f, a, p = lines(GI.getpoint(l1), color = :blue)
scatter!(GI.getpoint(l1), color = :blue)
lines!(GI.getpoint(l2), color = :orange)
scatter!(GI.getpoint(l2), color = :orange)
```
We can see that the two lines overlap in the plot:
```@example cshape
overlap(l1, l2)
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

First, we implement a wrapper method that dispatches to the correct
implementation based on the geometry trait. This is also used in the
implementation, since it's a lot less work! 

Note that that since only elements of the same dimension can overlap, any two
geometries with traits that are of different dimensions autmoatically can
return false.

For geometries with the same trait dimension, we must make sure that they share
a point, an edge, or area for points, lines, and polygons/multipolygons
respectivly, without being contained.

"""
    overlaps(geom1, geom2)::Bool

Compare two Geometries of the same dimension and return true if their
intersection set results in a geometry different from both but of the same
dimension. This means one geometry cannot be within or contain the other and
they cannot be equal
