## What is touches?

The touches function checks if one geometry touches another geometry. In other
words, the interiors of the two geometries don't interact, but one of the
geometries must have a boundary point that interacts with either the other
geometies interior or boundary.


To provide an example, consider these two lines:
```@example touches
using GeometryOps
using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
using Makie
using CairoMakie

l1 = Line([Point(0.0, 0.0), Point(1.0, 0.0)])
l2 = Line([Point(1.0, 0.0), Point(1.0, -1.0)])

f, a, p = lines(l1)
lines!(l2)
```
We can see that these two lines touch only at their endpoints.
```@example touches
touches(l1, l2)  # true
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

First, we implement a wrapper method that dispatches to the correct
implementation based on the geometry trait.

Each of these calls a method in the geom_geom_processors file. The methods in
this file determine if the given geometries meet a set of criteria. For the
`touches` function and arguments g1 and g2, this criteria is as follows:
    - points of g1 are not allowed to be in the interior of g2
    - points of g1 are allowed to be on the boundary of g2
    - points of g1 are allowed to be in the exterior of g2
    - no points of g1 are required to be in the interior of g2
    - at least one point of g1 is required to be on the boundary of g2
    - no points of g1 are required to be in the exterior of g2

The code for the specific implementations is in the geom_geom_processors file.
=#

const TOUCHES_POINT_ALLOWED = (in_allow = false, on_allow = true, out_allow = false)
const TOUCHES_CURVE_ALLOWED = (over_allow = false, cross_allow = false, on_allow = true, out_allow = true)
const TOUCHES_POLYGON_ALLOWS = (in_allow = false, on_allow = true, out_allow = true)
const TOUCHES_REQUIRES = (in_require = false, on_require = true, out_require = false)

"""
    touches(geom1, geom2)::Bool

Return `true` if the first geometry touches the second geometry. In other words,
the two interiors cannot interact, but one of the geometries must have a
boundary point that interacts with either the other geometies interior or
boundary.

## Examples

import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI

l1 = GI.Line([(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0)])
l2 = GI.Line([(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, -1.0)])

GO.touches(l1, l2)
# output
true
