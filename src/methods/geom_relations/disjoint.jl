## What is disjoint?

The disjoint function checks if one geometry is outside of another geometry,
without sharing any boundaries or interiors.

To provide an example, consider these two lines:
```@example disjoint
using GeometryOps
using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
using Makie
using CairoMakie

l1 = GI.LineString([(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.1)])
l2 = GI.LineString([(2.0, 0.0), (2.75, 0.0)])
f, a, p = lines(GI.getpoint(l1), color = :blue)
scatter!(GI.getpoint(l1), color = :blue)
lines!(GI.getpoint(l2), color = :orange)
scatter!(GI.getpoint(l2), color = :orange)
```
We can see that none of the edges or vertices of l1 interact with l2 so they are
disjoint.
```@example disjoint
disjoint(l1, l2)  # returns true
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

First, we implement a wrapper method that dispatches to the correct
implementation based on the geometry trait.

Each of these calls a method in the geom_geom_processors file. The methods in
this file determine if the given geometries meet a set of criteria. For the
`disjoint` function and arguments g1 and g2, this criteria is as follows:
    - points of g1 are not allowed to be in the interior of g2
    - points of g1 are not allowed to be on the boundary of g2
    - points of g1 are allowed to be in the exterior of g2
    - no points required to be in the interior of g2
    - no points of g1 are required to be on the boundary of g2
    - no points of g1 are required to be in the exterior of g2

The code for the specific implementations is in the geom_geom_processors file.

"""
    disjoint(geom1, geom2)::Bool

Return `true` if the first geometry is disjoint from the second geometry.

Return `true` if the first geometry is disjoint from the second geometry. The
interiors and boundaries of both geometries must not intersect.

line = GI.LineString([(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)])
point = (2, 2)
GO.disjoint(point, line)

# output
