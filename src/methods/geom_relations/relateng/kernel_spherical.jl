# # Spherical RelateKernel
#
#=
Spherical implementation of the RelateKernel contract declared in `kernel.jl`,
over `UnitSphericalPoint{Float64}`. Every predicate is a sign of
det(u, v, w) = (u×v)·w, so the exact path mirrors planar: a float filter then an
exact fallback (`ExactPredicates.orient` for the plain orient, `Rational{BigInt}`
on the xyz components for composites). No intersection coordinate is ever
constructed. See the design doc 2026-06-15.

All of `cross`, `⋅`, `normalize` (LinearAlgebra), `ExactPredicates`, and the
`UnitSpherical` names are already in scope here — this file is `include`d into
`GeometryOps`, which `using`s them at the top of the module. The
`_rebuild_point(::UnitSphericalPoint, …)` hook that keeps node points typed
lives next to the generic `_rebuild_point` in `kernel.jl`.

# xyz tuple of a 3D point, for the ExactPredicates / Rational{BigInt} paths.

# ## rk_orient

# Orientation of `c` relative to the great-circle arc `(a, b)`: the sign of the
# scalar triple product (a×b)·c. Exact path: `ExactPredicates.orient` over the
# xyz tuples about the origin (the spike measured 3.5 ns); NOT
# `UnitSpherical.spherical_orient`, whose eps*16 tolerance is unfit for the
# exact contract. Float path: the plain triple product.
