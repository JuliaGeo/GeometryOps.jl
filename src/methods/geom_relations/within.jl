## What is within?

The within function checks if one geometry is inside another geometry. This
requires that the two interiors intersect and that the interior and
boundary of the first geometry is not in the exterior of the second geometry.

To provide an example, consider these two lines:
```@example cshape
using GeometryOps
using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
using Makie
using CairoMakie

l1 = GI.LineString([(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.1)])
l2 = GI.LineString([(0.25, 0.0), (0.75, 0.0)])
f, a, p = lines(GI.getpoint(l1), color = :blue)
scatter!(GI.getpoint(l1), color = :blue)
lines!(GI.getpoint(l2), color = :orange)
scatter!(GI.getpoint(l2), color = :orange)
```
We can see that all of the points and edges of l2 are within l1, so l2 is
within l1, but l1 is not within l2
```@example cshape
within(l1, l2)  # returns false
within(l2, l1)  # returns true
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

First, we implement a wrapper method that dispatches to the correct
implementation based on the geometry trait.

Each of these calls a method in the geom_geom_processors file. The methods in
this file determine if the given geometries meet a set of criteria. For the
`within` function and arguments g1 and g2, this criteria is as follows:
    - points of g1 are allowed to be in the interior of g2 (either through
    overlap or crossing for lines)
    - points of g1 are allowed to be on the boundary of g2
    - points of g1 are not allowed to be in the exterior of g2
    - at least one point of g1 is required to be in the interior of g2
    - no points of g1 are required to be on the boundary of g2
    - no points of g1 are required to be in the exterior of g2

The code for the specific implementations is in the geom_geom_processors file.
=#

const WITHIN_POINT_ALLOWS = (in_allow = true, on_allow = false, out_allow = false)
const WITHIN_CURVE_ALLOWS = (over_allow = true, cross_allow = true, on_allow = true, out_allow = false)
const WITHIN_POLYGON_ALLOWS = (in_allow = true, on_allow = true, out_allow = false)
const WITHIN_REQUIRES = (in_require = true, on_require = false, out_require = false)

"""
    within(geom1, geom2)::Bool

Return `true` if the first geometry is completely within the second geometry.
The interiors of both geometries must intersect and the interior and boundary of
the primary geometry (geom1) must not intersect the exterior of the secondary
geometry (geom2).

Furthermore, `within` returns the exact opposite result of `contains`.

## Examples
```jldoctest setup=:(using GeometryOps, GeometryBasics)
import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI

line = GI.LineString([(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)])
point = (1, 2)
GO.within(point, line)

# output
true
