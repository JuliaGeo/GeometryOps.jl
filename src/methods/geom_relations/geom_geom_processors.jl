Determine if point is in, on, or out of a closed curve, which includes the space
enclosed by the closed curve.

`In` means the point is within the closed curve (excluding edges and vertices).
`On` means the point is on an edge or a vertex of the closed curve.
`Out` means the point is outside of the closed curve.

Point should be an object of point trait and curve should be an object with a
linestring or linearring trait, that is assumed to be closed, regardless of
repeated last point.

Can provide values of in, on, and out keywords, which determines return values
for each scenario.

https://doi.org/10.3390/sym10100477
Paper seperates orientation of point and edge into 26 cases. For each case, it
is either a case where the point is on the edge (returns on), where a ray from
the point (x, y) to infinity along the line y = y cut through the edge (k += 1),
or the ray does not pass through the edge (do nothing and continue). If the ray
passes through an odd number of edges, it is within the curve, else outside of
of the curve if it didn't return 'on'.
See paper for more information on cases denoted in comments.

#=
Determines the type of interaction between two line segments. If the segments
`cross`, this means that they have a single intersection point that isn't on
either of their enpoints. If they form a `hinge`, they meet at one of the
segments endpoints. If they are `over`, then they are co-linear for at least
some of the length of the segments. Finally, if they are `out`, then the
segments are disjoint.

Point should be an object of point trait and curve should be an object with a
linestring or linearring trait.

Can provide values of in, on, and out keywords, which determines return values
for each scenario.

#=
Determines the types of interactions of a line with a filled-in curve. By
filled-in curve, I am referring to the exterior ring of a poylgon, for example.

Returns a tuple of booleans: (in_curve, on_curve, out_curve).

If in_curve is true, some of the lines interior points interact with the curve's
    interior points.
If on_curve is true, endpoints of either the line intersect with the curve or
    the line interacts with the polygon boundary.
If out_curve is true, at least one segments of the line is outside the curve.

If closed_line is true, line is treated as a closed line where the first and
last point are connected by a segment.
