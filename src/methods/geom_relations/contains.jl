## What is contains?

The contains function checks if a given geometry completly contains another
geometry, or in other words, that the second geometry is completly within the
first. This requires that the two interiors intersect and that the interior and
boundary of the second geometry is not in the exterior of the first geometry.

To provide an example, consider these two lines:
```@example contains
using GeometryOps
using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
using Makie
using CairoMakie

l1 = GI.LineString([(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.1)])
l2 = GI.LineString([(0.25, 0.0), (0.75, 0.0)])
f, a, p = lines(GI.getpoint(l1), color = :blue)
scatter!(GI.getpoint(l1), color = :blue)
lines!(GI.getpoint(l2), color = :orange)
scatter!(GI.getpoint(l2), color = :orange)
```
We can see that all of the points and edges of l2 are within l1, so l1 contains
l2. However, l2 does not contain l1.
```@example contains
contains(l1, l2)  # returns true
contains(l2, l1)  # returns false
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

Given that contains is the exact opposite of within, we simply pass the two
inputs variables, swapped in order, to within.
=#

"""
    contains(g1::AbstractGeometry, g2::AbstractGeometry)::Bool

Return true if the second geometry is completely contained by the first
geometry. The interiors of both geometries must intersect and the interior and
boundary of the secondary (g2) must not intersect the exterior of the first
(g1).

`contains` returns the exact opposite result of `within`.

## Examples

```jldoctest
import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI
line = GI.LineString([(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)])
point = GI.Point((1, 2))

GO.contains(line, point)
# output
true
```
"""
contains(g1, g2) = GeometryOps.within(g2, g1)
