"""
    difference(geom_a, geom_b, [T::Type]; target::Type)

Return the difference between two geometries as a list of geometries. Return an empty list
if none are found. The type of the list will be constrained as much as possible given the
input geometries. Furthermore, the user can provide a `taget` type as a keyword argument and
a list of target geometries found in the difference will be returned. The user can also
provide a float type that they would like the points of returned geometries to be. 

## Example 

```jldoctest
import GeoInterface as GI, GeometryOps as GO

poly1 = GI.Polygon([[[0.0, 0.0], [5.0, 5.0], [10.0, 0.0], [5.0, -5.0], [0.0, 0.0]]])
poly2 = GI.Polygon([[[3.0, 0.0], [8.0, 5.0], [13.0, 0.0], [8.0, -5.0], [3.0, 0.0]]])
diff_poly = GO.difference(poly1, poly2; target = GI.PolygonTrait)
GI.coordinates.(diff_poly)

# output
1-element Vector{Vector{Vector{Vector{Float64}}}}:
 [[[6.5, 3.5], [5.0, 5.0], [0.0, 0.0], [5.0, -5.0], [6.5, -3.5], [3.0, 0.0], [6.5, 3.5]]]
