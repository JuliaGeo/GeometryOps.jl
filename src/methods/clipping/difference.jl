    difference(geom_a, geom_b, [T::Type]; target::Type, fix_multipoly = UnionIntersectingPolygons())

Return the difference between two geometries as a list of geometries. Return an empty list
if none are found. The type of the list will be constrained as much as possible given the
input geometries. Furthermore, the user can provide a `taget` type as a keyword argument and
a list of target geometries found in the difference will be returned. The user can also
provide a float type that they would like the points of returned geometries to be. If the
user is taking a intersection involving one or more multipolygons, and the multipolygon
might be comprised of polygons that intersect, if `fix_multipoly` is set to an
`IntersectingPolygons` correction (the default is `UnionIntersectingPolygons()`), then the
needed multipolygons will be fixed to be valid before performing the intersection to ensure
a correct answer. Only set `fix_multipoly` to false if you know that the multipolygons are
valid, as it will avoid unneeded computation. 

## Example

import GeoInterface as GI, GeometryOps as GO

poly1 = GI.Polygon([[[0.0, 0.0], [5.0, 5.0], [10.0, 0.0], [5.0, -5.0], [0.0, 0.0]]])
poly2 = GI.Polygon([[[3.0, 0.0], [8.0, 5.0], [13.0, 0.0], [8.0, -5.0], [3.0, 0.0]]])
diff_poly = GO.difference(poly1, poly2; target = GI.PolygonTrait())
GI.coordinates.(diff_poly)

# output
1-element Vector{Vector{Vector{Vector{Float64}}}}:
 [[[6.5, 3.5], [5.0, 5.0], [0.0, 0.0], [5.0, -5.0], [6.5, -3.5], [3.0, 0.0], [6.5, 3.5]]]

when the start point is a entry point and is a bouncing point when the start point is an
exit point. The end of the chain has the opposite crossing / bouncing status. =#

are crossing if the current polygon's adjacent edges are within the non-tracing polygon and
we are tracing b_list or if the edges are outside and we are on a_list. Otherwise the
endpoints are marked as crossing. x is a boolean representing if the edges are inside or
outside of the polygon and y is a variable that is true if we are on a_list and false if we
are on b_list. =#

point and we are currently tracing b_list or if it was an exit point and we are currently

that is true if we are on a_list and false if we are on b_list. =#
