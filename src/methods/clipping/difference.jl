    difference(geom_a, geom_b, [T::Type]; target::Type)

Return the difference between two geometries as a list of geometries. Return an empty list
if none are found. The type of the list will be constrained as much as possible given the
input geometries. Furthermore, the user can provide a `taget` type as a keyword argument and
a list of target geometries found in the difference will be returned. The user can also
provide a float type that they would like the points of returned geometries to be. 

## Example 

```jldoctest
import GeoInterface as GI, GeometryOps as GO

poly1 = GI.Polygon([[[0.0, 0.0], [5.0, 5.0], [10.0, 0.0], [5.0, -5.0], [0.0, 0.0]]])
poly2 = GI.Polygon([[[3.0, 0.0], [8.0, 5.0], [13.0, 0.0], [8.0, -5.0], [3.0, 0.0]]])
diff_poly = GO.difference(poly1, poly2; target = GI.PolygonTrait())
GI.coordinates.(diff_poly)

# output
1-element Vector{Vector{Vector{Vector{Float64}}}}:
 [[[6.5, 3.5], [5.0, 5.0], [0.0, 0.0], [5.0, -5.0], [6.5, -3.5], [3.0, 0.0], [6.5, 3.5]]]

#= When marking the crossing status of a delayed crossing, the chain start point is crossing
when the start point is a entry point and is a bouncing point when the start point is an
exit point. The end of the chain has the opposite crossing / bouncing status. =#

#= When marking the crossing status of a delayed bouncing, the chain start and end points
are crossing if the current polygon's adjacent edges are within the non-tracing polygon and
we are tracing b_list or if the edges are outside and we are on a_list. Otherwise the
endpoints are marked as crossing. x is a boolean representing if the edges are inside or
outside of the polygon and y is a variable that is true if we are on a_list and false if we
are on b_list. =#
_diff_delay_bounce_f(x, y) = x ⊻ y
#= When tracing polygons, step forwards if the most recent intersection point was an entry
point and we are currently tracing b_list or if it was an exit point and we are currently
tracing a_list, else step backwards, where x is the entry/exit status and y is a variable
that is true if we are on a_list and false if we are on b_list. =#
