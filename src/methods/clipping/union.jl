# # Union Polygon Clipping
export union

"""
    union(geom_a, geom_b, [::Type{T}]; target::Type)

Return the union between two geometries as a list of geometries. Return an empty list if
none are found. The type of the list will be constrained as much as possible given the input
geometries. Furthermore, the user can provide a `taget` type as a keyword argument and a
list of target geometries found in the difference will be returned. The user can also
provide a float type 'T' that they would like the points of returned geometries to be. 
    
Calculates the union between two polygons.
## Example

```jldoctest
import GeoInterface as GI, GeometryOps as GO

p1 = GI.Polygon([[(0.0, 0.0), (5.0, 5.0), (10.0, 0.0), (5.0, -5.0), (0.0, 0.0)]])
p2 = GI.Polygon([[(3.0, 0.0), (8.0, 5.0), (13.0, 0.0), (8.0, -5.0), (3.0, 0.0)]])
union_poly = GO.union(p1, p2; target = GI.PolygonTrait)
GI.coordinates.(union_poly)

# output
1-element Vector{Vector{Vector{Vector{Float64}}}}:
 [[[6.5, 3.5], [5.0, 5.0], [0.0, 0.0], [5.0, -5.0], [6.5, -3.5], [8.0, -5.0], [13.0, 0.0], [8.0, 5.0], [6.5, 3.5]]]
