    _build_ab_list(::Type{T}, poly_a, poly_b) -> (a_list, b_list, a_idx_list)

This function takes in two polygon rings and calls '_build_a_list', '_build_b_list', and
'_flag_ent_exit' in order to fully form a_list and b_list. The 'a_list' and 'b_list' that it
returns are the fully updated vectors of PolyNodes that represent the rings 'poly_a' and
'poly_b', respectively. This function also returns 'a_idx_list', which at its "ith" index
stores the index in 'a_list' at which the "ith" intersection point lies.

    _build_a_list(::Type{T}, poly_a, poly_b) -> (a_list, a_idx_list)

This function take in two polygon rings and creates a vector of PolyNodes to represent
poly_a, including its intersection points with poly_b. The information stored in each
PolyNode is needed for clipping using the Greiner-Hormann clipping algorithm.
    
Note: After calling this function, a_list is not fully formed because the neighboring
indicies of the intersection points in b_list still need to be updated. Also we still have
not update the entry and exit flags for a_list.
    
The a_idx_list is a list of the indicies of intersection points in a_list. The value at
index i of a_idx_list is the location in a_list where the ith intersection point lies.

    _trace_polynodes(::Type{T}, a_list, b_list, a_idx_list, f_step)::Vector{GI.Polygon}

This function takes the outputs of _build_ab_list and traces the lists to determine which
polygons are formed as described in Greiner and Hormann. The function f_step determines in
which direction the lists are traced.  This function is different for intersection,
difference, and union. f_step must take in two arguments: the most recent intersection
node's entry/exit status and a boolean that is true if we are currently tracing a_list and
false if we are tracing b_list. The functions used for each clipping operation are follows:
    - Intersection: (x, y) -> x ? 1 : (-1)
    - Difference: (x, y) -> (x ⊻ y) ? 1 : (-1)
    - Union: (x, y) -> x ? (-1) : 1

A list of GeoInterface polygons is returned from this function.

The new hole is combined with any existing holes in curr_poly. The holes can be combined
into a larger hole if they are intersecting. If this happens, then the new, combined hole is
returned with the orignal holes making up the new hole removed from curr_poly. Additionally,
if the combined holes form a ring, the interior is added to the return_polys as a new
polygon piece. Additionally, holes leftover after combination will be checked for it they
are in the "main" polygon or in one of these new pieces and moved accordingly. 

If the holes don't touch or curr_poly has no holes, then new_hole is returned without any
changes.
