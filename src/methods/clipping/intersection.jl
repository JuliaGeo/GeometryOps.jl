    intersection(geom_a, geom_b, [T::Type]; target::Type, fix_multipoly = UnionIntersectingPolygons())

Return the intersection between two geometries as a list of geometries. Return an empty list
if none are found. The type of the list will be constrained as much as possible given the
input geometries. Furthermore, the user can provide a `target` type as a keyword argument and
a list of target geometries found in the intersection will be returned. The user can also
provide a float type that they would like the points of returned geometries to be. If the
user is taking a intersection involving one or more multipolygons, and the multipolygon
might be comprised of polygons that intersect, if `fix_multipoly` is set to an
`IntersectingPolygons` correction (the default is `UnionIntersectingPolygons()`), then the
needed multipolygons will be fixed to be valid before performing the intersection to ensure
a correct answer. Only set `fix_multipoly` to nothing if you know that the multipolygons are
valid, as it will avoid unneeded computation.

#= Calculates the intersection points between two lines if they exists and the fractional
component of each line from the initial end point to the intersection point where α is the
fraction along (a1, a2) and β is the fraction along (b1, b2).

Note that the first return is the type of intersection (line_cross, line_hinge, line_over,
or line_out). The type of intersection determines how many intersection points there are.
If the intersection is line_out, then there are no intersection points and the two
intersections aren't valid and shouldn't be used. If the intersection is line_cross or
line_hinge then the lines meet at one point and the first intersection is valid, while the
second isn't. Finally, if the intersection is line_over, then both points are valid and they
are the two points that define the endpoints of the overlapping region between the two
lines.

Also note again that each intersection is a tuple of two tuples. The first is the
intersection point (x,y) while the second is the ratio along the initial lines (α, β) for
that point.
