# # Barycentric coordinates
# Generalized barycentric coordinates are a generalization of barycentric coordinates, 
# which are typically used in triangles, to arbitrary polygons. 

# They provide a way to express a point within a polygon as a weighted average 
# of the polygon's vertices.

# In the case of a triangle, barycentric coordinates are a set of three numbers 
# $(λ_1, λ_2, λ_3)$, each associated with a vertex of the triangle. Any point within 
# the triangle can be expressed as a weighted average of the vertices, where the 
# weights are the barycentric coordinates. The weights sum to 1, and each is non-negative.

# For a polygon with n vertices, generalized barycentric coordinates are a set of 
# $n$ numbers $(λ_1, λ_2, ..., λ_n)$, each associated with a vertex of the polygon. 
# Any point within the polygon can be expressed as a weighted average of the vertices, 
# where the weights are the generalized barycentric coordinates. 

# As with the triangle case, the weights sum to 1, and each is non-negative.

# ## Methods to find barycentric coordinates

    # Describe this loop
    # The loop computes barycentric coordinates by the mean-value method.
    # The mean-value method is a method for computing barycentric coordinates
    # for a point in a polygon. It is based on the observation that the
    # barycentric coordinates of a point in a polygon are proportional to the
    # areas of the triangles formed by the point and each pair of edges of the
    # polygon. The mean-value method computes the areas of these triangles by
    # computing the areas of the triangles formed by the point and each pair of
    # edges of the polygon, and then averaging these areas.

# ```
# You can see that the polygon triangulation doesn't do any justice to the actual structure.  Let's visualize it using mean value coordinates:
# ```@example barycentric
# polygon_zs = last.(polygon_points)
# xrange = LinRange(0, 0.5, 1000)
# yrange = LinRange(0, 0.5, 1000)
# @time mean_value_coordinate_field = mean_value_barycentric_coordinates.(
#     (Point2{Float64}.(polygon_points),), 
#     Point2{Float64}.(xrange, yrange')
# )
# ```
# This returned a list of vectors of weights, one for each point in the grid.  

# We can use these vectors to extrapolate and interpolate from the z values of the polygon to some z value at each point in the grid:
# ```@example barycentric
# mean_values = map(mean_value_coordinate_field) do λs
#     sum(λs .* polygon_zs)
# end
# ```
# Now, we can visualize this!
# ```@example barycentric
# f, a, p = heatmap(xrange, yrange, mean_values; colormap = cgrad(:jet, 18; categorical = true))
# poly!(Point2f.(polygon_points); color = :transparent, strokecolor = :black, strokewidth = 1.3)
# Colorbar(f[1, 2], p)
# f
