## What is equals?

The equals function checks if two geometries are equal. They are equal if they
share the same set of points and edges to define the same shape.

To provide an example, consider these two lines:
```@example cshape
using GeometryOps
using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
using Makie
using CairoMakie

l1 = GI.LineString([(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 10.0)])
l2 = GI.LineString([(0.0, -10.0), (0.0, 3.0)])
f, a, p = lines(GI.getpoint(l1), color = :blue)
scatter!(GI.getpoint(l1), color = :blue)
lines!(GI.getpoint(l2), color = :orange)
scatter!(GI.getpoint(l2), color = :orange)
```
We can see that the two lines do not share a commen set of points and edges in
the plot, so they are not equal:
```@example cshape
equals(l1, l2)  # returns false
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

First, we implement a wrapper method that dispatches to the correct
implementation based on the geometry trait. This is also used in the
implementation, since it's a lot less work! 

Note that while we need the same set of points and edges, they don't need to be
provided in the same order for polygons. For for example, we need the same set
points for two multipoints to be equal, but they don't have to be saved in the
same order. The winding order also doesn't have to be the same to represent the
same geometry. This requires checking every point against every other point in
the two geometries we are comparing. Also, some geometries must be "closed" like
polygons and linear rings. These will be assumed to be closed, even if they
don't have a repeated last point explicity written in the coordinates.
Additionally, geometries and multi-geometries can be equal if the multi-geometry
only includes that single geometry.
