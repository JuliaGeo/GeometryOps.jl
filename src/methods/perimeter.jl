# Perimeter

Computes the perimeter of a geometry.

Perimeter is not defined for points and multipoints.

For linestrings and linearrings, it is the sum of the lengths of the segments.
For polygons, it is the sum of the lengths of the exterior and holes of the polygon.
For multipolygons, it is the sum of the perimeters of the polygons in the multipolygon.
For geometry collections, it is the sum of the perimeters of the geometries in the collection. 
The geometry collections cannot have point or multipoint geometries.

TODOs:
- Add support for point geometries
- Add support for a "true 3D" perimeter

```@example perimeter
import GeoInterface as GI, GeometryOps as GO

outer = GI.LinearRing([(0,0),(10,0),(10,10),(0,10),(0,0)])
hole1 = GI.LinearRing([(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,1),(1,1)])
hole2 = GI.LinearRing([(5,5),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(5,5)])

p = GI.Polygon([outer, hole1, hole2])
mp = GI.MultiPolygon([
    p, 
    GO.transform(x -> x .+ 12, GI.Polygon([outer, hole1]))
])

(p, mp)
```
```@example perimeter
GO.perimeter(p) # should be 48
```
```@example perimeter
GO.perimeter(mp) # should be 92
