## What is the centroid?

The centroid is the geometric center of a line string or area(s). Note that
the centroid does not need to be inside of a concave area.

Further note that by convention a line, or linear ring, is calculated by
weighting the line segments by their length, while polygons and multipolygon
centroids are calculated by weighting edge's by their 'area components'.

To provide an example, consider this concave polygon in the shape of a 'C':
```@example cshape
using GeometryOps
using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
using Makie
using CairoMakie

cshape = Polygon([
    Point(0,0), Point(0,3), Point(3,3), Point(3,2), Point(1,2),
    Point(1,1), Point(3,1), Point(3,0), Point(0,0),
])
f, a, p = poly(cshape; axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
```
Let's see what the centroid looks like (plotted in red):
```@example cshape
cent = centroid(cshape)
scatter!(a, GI.x(cent), GI.y(cent), color = :red)
f
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

First, we implement a wrapper method that dispatches to the correct
implementation based on the geometry trait. This is also used in the
implementation, since it's a lot less work! 

Note that if you call centroid on a LineString or LinearRing, the
centroid_and_length function will be called due to the weighting scheme
described above, while centroid_and_area is called for polygons and
multipolygons. However, centroid_and_area can still be called on a
LineString or LinearRing when they are closed, for example as the interior hole
of a polygon.

The helper functions centroid_and_length and centroid_and_area are made
availible just in case the user also needs the area or length to decrease
repeat computation.
