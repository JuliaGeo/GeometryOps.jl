# ## What is signed area?

# Signed area is simply the integral over the exterior path of a polygon, 
# minus the sum of integrals over its interior holes.

# It is signed such that a clockwise path has a positive area, and a
# counterclockwise path has a negative area.

# To provide an example, consider this rectangle:
# ```@example rect
# using GeometryOps
# using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
# using Makie
# 
# rect = Polygon([Point(0,0), Point(0,1), Point(1,1), Point(1,0), Point(0, 0)])
# f, a, p = poly(rect; axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
# ```
# This is clearly a rectangle, etc.  But now let's look at how the points look:
# ```@example rect
# lines!(a, rect; color = 1:length(coordinates(rect))+1)
# f
# ```
# The points are ordered in a clockwise fashion, which means that the signed area
# is positive.  If we reverse the order of the points, we get a negative area.

# ## Implementation

# This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

# First, we implement a wrapper method that dispatches to the correct
# implementation based on the geometry trait.
# 
# This is also used in the implementation, since it's a lot less work!
