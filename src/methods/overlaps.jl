# # Overlap checks

export overlaps

# This code checks whether geometries overlap with each other.  

# It does not compute the overlap or intersection geometry.

"""
    overlaps(geom1, geom2)::Bool

Compare two Geometries of the same dimension and return true if their intersection set results in a geometry
different from both but of the same dimension. It applies to Polygon/Polygon, LineString/LineString,
Multipoint/Multipoint, MultiLineString/MultiLineString and MultiPolygon/MultiPolygon.

## Examples
```jldoctest
import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI
poly1 = GI.Polygon([[(0,0), (0,5), (5,5), (5,0), (0,0)]])
poly2 = GI.Polygon([[(1,1), (1,6), (6,6), (6,1), (1,1)]])

GO.overlaps(poly1, poly2)
# output
true
```
