# # Overlap checks

export overlaps

# This code checks whether geometries overlap with each other.  

# It does not compute the overlap or intersection geometry.

"""
    overlaps(geom1, geom2)::Bool

Compare two Geometries of the same dimension and return true if their intersection set results in a geometry
different from both but of the same dimension. It applies to Polygon/Polygon, LineString/LineString,
Multipoint/Multipoint, MultiLineString/MultiLineString and MultiPolygon/MultiPolygon.

## Examples
```jldoctest
julia> poly1 = Polygon([[[0,0],[0,5],[5,5],[5,0],[0,0]]])
Polygon(Array{Array{Float64,1},1}[[[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 5.0], [5.0, 5.0], [5.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0]]])

julia> poly2 = Polygon([[[1,1],[1,6],[6,6],[6,1],[1,1]]])
Polygon(Array{Array{Float64,1},1}[[[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0], [6.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]]])

julia> overlap(poly1, poly2)
true
