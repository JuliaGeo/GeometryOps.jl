# Convex hull

The [_convex hull_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of a set of points is the smallest [**convex**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set) polygon that contains all the points.

GeometryOps.jl provides a number of methods for computing the convex hull of a set of points, usually
linked to other Julia packages.  

For now, we expose one algorithm, [MonotoneChainMethod](@ref), which uses the [DelaunayTriangulation.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/DelaunayTriangulation.jl) 
package.  The `GEOS()` interface also supports convex hulls.  

Future work could include other algorithms, such as [Quickhull.jl](https://github.com/augustt198/Quickhull.jl), or similar, via package extensions.


## Example

### Simple hull
```@example simple
import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI
using CairoMakie # to plot

points = randn(GO.Point2f, 100)
f, a, p = plot(points; label = "Points")
hull_poly = GO.convex_hull(points)
lines!(a, hull_poly; label = "Convex hull", color = Makie.wong_colors()[2])
axislegend(a)
f
```

## Convex hull of the USA
```@example usa
import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI
using CairoMakie # to plot
using NaturalEarth # for data

all_adm0 = naturalearth("admin_0_countries", 110)
usa = all_adm0.geometry[findfirst(==("USA"), all_adm0.ADM0_A3)]
f, a, p = lines(usa)
lines!(a, GO.convex_hull(usa); color = Makie.wong_colors()[2])
f
```

## Investigating the winding order

The winding order of the monotone chain method is counterclockwise,
while the winding order of the GEOS method is clockwise.

GeometryOps' convexity detection says that the GEOS hull is convex,
while the monotone chain method hull is not.  However, they are both going
over the same points (we checked), it's just that the winding order is different.

In reality, both sets are convex, but we need to fix the GeometryOps convexity detector 
([`isconcave`](@ref))!

We may also decide at a later date to change the returned winding order of the polygon, but
most algorithms are robust to that, and you can always [`fix`](@ref) it...

```@example windingorder
import GeoInterface as GI, GeometryOps as GO, LibGEOS as LG
using CairoMakie # to plot

points = rand(Point2{Float64}, 100)
go_hull = GO.convex_hull(GO.MonotoneChainMethod(), points)
lg_hull = GO.convex_hull(GO.GEOS(), points)

fig = Figure()
a1, p1 = lines(fig[1, 1], go_hull; color = 1:GI.npoint(go_hull), axis = (; title = "MonotoneChainMethod()"))
a2, p2 = lines(fig[2, 1], lg_hull; color = 1:GI.npoint(lg_hull), axis = (; title = "GEOS()"))
cb = Colorbar(fig[1:2, 2], p1; label = "Vertex number")
fig
```

## Implementation

=#

"""
    convex_hull([method], geometries)

Compute the convex hull of the points in `geometries`.  
Returns a `GI.Polygon` representing the convex hull.

Note that the polygon returned is wound counterclockwise
as in the Simple Features standard by default.  If you 
choose GEOS, the winding order will be inverted.

!!! warning
    This interface only computes the 2-dimensional convex hull!

    For higher dimensional hulls, use the relevant package (Qhull.jl, Quickhull.jl, or similar).
"""
function convex_hull end

"""
    MonotoneChainMethod()

This is an algorithm for the [`convex_hull`](@ref) function.

Uses [`DelaunayTriangulation.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/DelaunayTriangulation.jl) to compute the convex hull.
This is a pure Julia algorithm which provides an optimal Delaunay triangulation.

See also [`convex_hull`](@ref)
