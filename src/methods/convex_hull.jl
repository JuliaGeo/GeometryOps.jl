# Convex hull

The _convex hull_ of a set of points is the smallest **convex** polygon that contains all the points.

GeometryOps.jl provides a number of methods for computing the convex hull of a set of points, usually
linked to other Julia packages.  

## Example

### Simple hull
```@example simple
import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI
using CairoMakie # to plot

points = randn(GO.Point2f, 100)
f, a, p = plot(points; label = "Points")
hull_poly = GO.convex_hull(points)
lines!(a, hull_poly; label = "Convex hull", color = Makie.wong_colors()[2])
axislegend(a)
f
```

## Convex hull of the USA
```@example usa
import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI
using CairoMakie # to plot
using NaturalEarth # for data

all_adm0 = naturalearth("admin_0_countries", 110)
usa = all_adm0.geometry[findfirst(==("USA"), all_adm0.ADM0_A3)]
f, a, p = lines(usa)
lines!(a, GO.convex_hull(usa); color = Makie.wong_colors()[2])
f
```

Compute the convex hull of the points in `geometries`.  
Returns a `GI.Polygon` representing the convex hull.

!!! warning
    This interface only computes the 2-dimensional convex hull!

    DelaunayTriangulationMethod()

This is an algorithm for the [`convex_hull`](@ref) function.

Uses [`DelaunayTriangulation.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/DelaunayTriangulation.jl) to compute the convex hull.
This is a pure Julia algorithm which provides an optimal Delaunay triangulation.
