# Types

This file defines some types used in GeometryOps.  

!!! warning
    Many type definitions are in `GeometryOpsCore`, not here.  Look there for the definitions of the basic types like `Manifold`, `Algorithm`, etc.


## Naming

We force all our external algorithm types to be uppercase, to make them different
from the package names.  This is really relevant for the `PROJ` algorithm, since 
the Julia package is called `Proj.jl`.  If we called our type `Proj`, it would
conflict with the package's name - as we saw with GeoFormatTypes' `GeoJSON` and `GeoJSON.jl`.

## `GEOS`

`GEOS` is a struct which instructs the method it's passed to as an algorithm
to use the appropriate GEOS function via `LibGEOS.jl` for the operation.

It's generally a lot slower than the native Julia implementations, but it's
useful for two reasons:
1. Functionality which doesn't exist in GeometryOps can be accessed through the GeometryOps API, but use GEOS in the backend until someone implements a native Julia version.
2. It's a good way to test the correctness of the native implementations.

# ## C-library planar algorithms
"""
    abstract type CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm <: GeometryOpsCore.SingleManifoldAlgorithm{Planar} end

This is a type which extends `GeometryOpsCore.SingleManifoldAlgorithm{Planar}`,
and is used as an abstract supertype for some C library based algorithms.

The type requires that algorithm structs be arranged as:
```
struct MyAlgorithm <: CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm
    manifold::Planar
    params::NamedTuple
end
```

Then you get a nice constructor for free, as well as the 
`get(alg, key, value)` and `get(alg, key) do ...` syntax.
Plus the [`enforce`](@ref) method, which will check that given keyword arguments
are present.

    nt = NamedTuple(params)

manifold(alg::CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm) = Planar()
best_manifold(alg::CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm, input) = Planar()

# Rebuild methods with manifolds are here.
function rebuild(alg::T, m::Planar) where {T <: CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm}
    return T(alg.params) # TODO: should this not rebuild at all, then, since nothing will change?
end
function rebuild(alg::T, m::AutoManifold) where {T <: CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm}
    return T(alg.params) # "rebuild" as a planar algorithm.
end
function rebuild(alg::T, m::M) where {T <: CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm, M <: Manifold}
    throw(GeometryOpsCore.WrongManifoldException{M, Planar, T}("The algorithm `$(typeof(alg))` is only compatible with planar manifolds."))
end
# Rebuild methods for parameters are here.  This ends up being quite useful really.

# `alg.params` every time.

"""
    enforce(alg::CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm, kw::Symbol, f)

Enforce the presence of a keyword argument in a `GEOS` algorithm, and return `alg.params[kw]`.

Throws an error if the key is not present, and mentions `f` in the error message (since there isn't 
a good way to get the name of the function that called this method).

This applies to all `CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm` types, like [`GEOS`](@ref) and [`TG`](@ref).
"""
function enforce(alg::CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm, kw::Symbol, f)
    if haskey(alg.params, kw)
        return alg.params[kw]
    else

    end

# ## GEOS - call into LibGEOS.jl

"""
    GEOS(; params...)

A struct which instructs the method it's passed to as an algorithm
to use the appropriate GEOS function via `LibGEOS.jl` for the operation.

Dispatch is generally carried out using the names of the keyword arguments.
For example, `segmentize` will only accept a `GEOS` struct with only a 
`max_distance` keyword, and no other.

It's generally somewhat slower than the native Julia implementations, since
it must convert to the LibGEOS implementation and back - so be warned!

## Extended help

This uses the [LibGEOS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/LibGEOS.jl) package,
which is a Julia wrapper around the C library GEOS (https://trac.osgeo.org/geos).
"""
struct GEOS <: CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm # SingleManifoldAlgorithm{Planar}
    params::NamedTuple
end

# ## TG - call into TGGeometry.jl

"""
    TG(; params...)

A struct which instructs the method it's passed to as an algorithm
to use the appropriate TG function via `TGGeometry.jl` for the operation.

It's generally a lot faster than the native Julia implementations, but only
supports planar manifolds / operations.  Also, it only supports geometric predicates,
specifically the ones which the underlying `tg` library supports.  These are:

[`equals`](@ref), [`intersects`](@ref), [`disjoint`](@ref), [`contains`](@ref), 
[`within`](@ref), [`covers`](@ref), [`coveredby`](@ref), and [`touches`](@ref).

## Extended help

This uses the [TGGeometry.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/TGGeometry.jl) package,
which is a Julia wrapper around the `tg` C library (https://github.com/tidwall/tg).
"""
struct TG <: CLibraryPlanarAlgorithm
    params::NamedTuple
end

# ## PROJ - call into Proj.jl

"""
    PROJ(; params...)

A struct which instructs the method it's passed to as an algorithm
to use the appropriate PROJ function via `Proj.jl` for the operation.

## Extended help

This is the default algorithm for [`reproject`](@ref), and will also be the default algorithm for 
operations on geodesics like [`area`](@ref) and [`arclength`](@ref).
