This function "segmentizes" or "densifies" a geometry by adding 
extra vertices to the geometry so that no segment is longer than 
a given distance.  This is useful for plotting geometries with a 
limited number of vertices, or for ensuring that a geometry is not 
too "coarse" for a given application.

!!! info
    We plan to add interpolated segmentization from DataInterpolations.jl in the future, 
    which will be available to any vector of point-like objects. 

    For now, this function only works on 2D geometries.  We will also support 3D geometries, as well as measure interpolation, in the future.

## Examples

```@example segmentize
import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI
rectangle = GI.Wrappers.Polygon([[(0.0, 50.0), (7.071, 57.07), (0, 64.14), (-7.07, 57.07), (0.0, 50.0)]])
linear = GO.segmentize(rectangle; max_distance = 5)
collect(GI.getpoint(linear))
```
You can see that this geometry was segmentized correctly, and now has 8 vertices where it previously had only 4.

Now, we'll also segmentize this using the geodetic method, which is more accurate for lat/lon coordinates.

```@example segmentize
geodesic = GO.segmentize(GO.GeodesicSegments(max_distance = 1000), rectangle)
length(GI.getpoint(geodesic) |> collect)
```
This has a lot of points!  It's important to keep in mind that the `max_distance` is in meters, so this is a very fine-grained segmentation.

Now, let's see what they look like!  To make this fair, we'll use approximately the same number of points for both.

```@example segmentize
using CairoMakie
linear = GO.segmentize(rectangle; max_distance = 0.01)
geodesic = GO.segmentize(GO.GeodesicSegments(max_distance = 1000), rectangle)
f, a, p = poly(collect(GI.getpoint(linear)); label = "Linear", axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
p2 = poly!(collect(GI.getpoint(geodesic)); label = "Geodesic")
axislegend(a; position = :lt)
f
```

There are two methods available for segmentizing geometries at the moment:

LinearSegments
GeodesicSegments

=#

abstract type SegmentizeMethod end
"""
    LinearSegments(; max_distance::Real)

A method for segmentizing geometries by adding extra vertices to the geometry so that no segment is longer than a given distance.

Here, `max_distance` is a purely nondimensional quantity and will apply in the input space.   This is to say, that if the polygon is
provided in lat/lon coordinates then the `max_distance` will be in degrees of arc.  If the polygon is provided in meters, then the 
`max_distance` will be in meters.
"""
Base.@kwdef struct LinearSegments <: SegmentizeMethod

end
"""
    GeodesicSegments(; max_distance::Real, equatorial_radius::Real=6378137, flattening::Real=1/298.257223563)

A method for segmentizing geometries by adding extra vertices to the geometry so that no segment is longer than a given distance.  
This method calculates the distance between points on the geodesic, and assumes input in lat/long coordinates.

!!! warning
    Any input geometries must be in lon/lat coordinates!  If not, the method may fail or error.

## Arguments
- `max_distance::Real`: The maximum distance, **in meters**, between vertices in the geometry.
- `equatorial_radius::Real=6378137`: The equatorial radius of the Earth, in meters.  Passed to `Proj.geod_geodesic`.
- `flattening::Real=1/298.257223563`: The flattening of the Earth, which is the ratio of the difference between the equatorial and polar radii to the equatorial radius.  Passed to `Proj.geod_geodesic`.

One can also omit the `equatorial_radius` and `flattening` keyword arguments, and pass a `geodesic` object directly to the eponymous keyword.

This method uses the Proj/GeographicLib API for geodesic calculations.

# ## Implementation

"""
    segmentize([method = LinearSegments()], geom; max_distance::Real, threaded)

Segmentize a geometry by adding extra vertices to the geometry so that no segment is longer than a given distance.  
This is useful for plotting geometries with a limited number of vertices, or for ensuring that a geometry is not too "coarse" for a given application.

## Arguments
- `method::SegmentizeMethod = LinearSegments()`: The method to use for segmentizing the geometry.  At the moment, only [`LinearSegments`](@ref) and [`GeodesicSegments`](@ref) are available.
- `geom`: The geometry to segmentize.  Must be a `LineString`, `LinearRing`, or greater in complexity.
- `max_distance::Real`: The maximum distance, **in the input space**, between vertices in the geometry.  Only used if you don't explicitly pass a `method`.

Returns a geometry of similar type to the input geometry, but resampled.
