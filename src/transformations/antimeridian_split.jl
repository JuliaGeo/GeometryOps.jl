## What is the antimeridian problem?

A longitude/latitude polygon that spans the ±180° meridian (the *antimeridian*,
or *seam*) cannot be drawn as a single planar ring: a vertex at 179°E and the
next at 179°W are neighbours on the globe, but 358° apart on the page. Renderers,
GeoJSON (RFC 7946 §3.1.9), and most planar clippers all assume consecutive
vertices are close in longitude, so a seam-crossing polygon paints a spurious
band right across the map.

The fix is to *cut* the polygon along the seam into pieces that each live within
one 360°-wide longitude branch. This is an **encoding repair, not a geometry
correction**: the spherical region is unchanged — we only re-express it as a
`MultiPolygon` whose parts avoid the seam. Because the trait of the output
differs from the input (a `Polygon` can become a two-part `MultiPolygon`), this
is a *transformation* that returns a new geometry, not a
`GeometryCorrection` that repairs in place.

## Why the pole row?

A piece that *encloses a pole* is bounded, on the seam side, by an edge that runs
**along the pole** — the polygon walks up the seam to (say) +180°, crosses the
pole, and comes back down at −180°. On the sphere that pole edge is a single
point (a zero-length geodesic: both corners are the same kernel point), so it
carries no area. But pseudocylindrical projections (plate carrée, Robinson, …)
map the pole to a *line*, and a two-vertex pole edge would draw as a single
straight segment cutting across the top/bottom of the map. Resampling the pole
edge into a monotone row of constant-latitude points (`pole_spacing`) makes that
line trace the projected pole correctly. The samples are collinear no-ops in
plate carrée and have exactly zero spherical area, so they never change the
region — they exist only so the projected outline is right.

## Composition with `segmentize`

Run [`antimeridian_split`](@ref) **after** [`segmentize`](@ref), never before.
Spherical `segmentize` of an on-meridian edge emits interpolated points whose
`atan2` longitude is +180 regardless of which branch the edge belongs to
(signed-zero normalisation), which would corrupt a −180-branch piece. Densify
first, split second.

## Arbitrary seam and rotated pole

`antimeridian = λ` cuts along the meridian `λ` instead of ±180. The input
coordinates are left **untouched** — only the cutting curve and the output
longitude encoding move — so exactness is fully preserved. `north_pole =
(λp, φp)` cuts along a seam through a *rotated* pole: the input is rotated into
the frame whose north pole sits at geographic `(λp, φp)` (the CF
`rotated_latitude_longitude` / PROJ `+proj=ob_tran` convention, with
`north_pole_grid_longitude = 0`), the split runs in that frame, and **the output
coordinates are in the rotated frame** — that is the point of the feature.
Mapping back would re-merge the seam and produce degenerate slit lips. The
rotation is the *only* step that moves a coordinate; everything else is the exact
arrangement operating on the (rotated) input.

## Example

```@example antimeridian
import GeometryOps as GO
import GeoInterface as GI

# a box straddling the ±180° seam (170°E … 170°W)
box = GI.Polygon([[(170.0, 40.0), (-170.0, 40.0), (-170.0, 50.0), (170.0, 50.0), (170.0, 40.0)]])
mp = GO.antimeridian_split(box)
GI.ngeom(mp)   # 2 pieces, one per branch
```
=#

# The split is inherently spherical; these are the manifold/exactness context the
# arrangement runs under.
const _AM_MANIFOLD = Spherical()
const _AM_EXACT = True()

# lat within this of ±90 is treated as the pole; lon within this of the seam
# meridian (mod 360) is treated as on-seam.
const _AM_POLE_TOL = 1e-9
const _AM_SEAM_TOL = 1e-9

"""
    antimeridian_split(geom; antimeridian = 180.0, north_pole = nothing, pole_spacing = 5.0, threaded = false)

Split the lon/lat polygons of `geom` at the antimeridian. Every `Polygon` /
`MultiPolygon` in `geom` is replaced by a `GI.MultiPolygon` whose pieces each
stay within one 360°-wide longitude branch (none crosses the seam); the spherical
region is preserved exactly — this is an encoding repair, not a geometry change.

`geom` may be a bare geometry, a feature, a feature collection, a table, or
(nested) vectors of any of those: the split runs through [`apply`](@ref) on the
`PolygonTrait`/`MultiPolygonTrait` target, so everything above the polygons is
rebuilt around the split result. A bare `Polygon` therefore comes back as a
`MultiPolygon`.

## Keyword arguments

- `antimeridian = 180.0`: the seam longitude `λ`. The cut runs along the meridian
  `λ` (normalised to `λn ∈ (-180, 180]`); the default reproduces the ±180°
  antimeridian. Emitted longitudes lie in the closed branch `[λn - 360, λn]`: the
  two seam lips are exactly `λn` (west-side pieces) and `λn - 360` (east-side
  pieces), and every non-seam vertex is strictly interior, in `(λn - 360, λn)`.
  At the default seam this is the usual `[-180, 180]` with lips at +180 / −180.
- `north_pole = nothing`: when set to `(λp, φp)`, cut along a seam through the
  rotated pole at geographic `(λp, φp)` (CF `rotated_latitude_longitude` /
  `+proj=ob_tran`, `north_pole_grid_longitude = 0`). **The returned coordinates
  are in the rotated frame**, not geographic — this is deliberate.
- `pole_spacing = 5.0`: maximum longitude step (degrees) of the constant-latitude
  row emitted along a pole edge of a pole-enclosing piece. `nothing` emits only
  the two branch corners. The corners are never optional — they are the
  topological product of the face walk; only the infill between them is
  controlled here.
- `threaded = false`: passed to [`apply`](@ref); threads over the outermost level
  of a collection input (array, feature collection, …).

Only `PolygonTrait` and `MultiPolygonTrait` geometries are supported; a bare
geometry of another trait throws an `ArgumentError` (LineString support is future
work).
