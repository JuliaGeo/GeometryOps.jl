# # Geometry Corrections

export fix

# This file simply defines the `GeometryCorrection` abstract type, and the interface that any `GeometryCorrection` must implement.
#=

A geometry correction is a transformation that is applied to a geometry to correct it in some way. 

For example, a [`ClosedRing`](@ref) correction might be applied to a `Polygon` to ensure that its exterior ring is closed.

## Interface

All `GeometryCorrection`s are callable structs which, when called, apply the correction to the given geometry, and return either a copy or the original geometry (if nothing needed to be corrected).

See below for the full interface specification.

```@docs; canonical = false
GeometryOps.GeometryCorrection
```

Any geometry correction must implement the interface as given above. 



=#

"""
    abstract type GeometryCorrection

This abstract type represents a geometry correction.

## Interface

Any `GeometryCorrection` must implement two functions:
    * `application_level(::GeometryCorrection)::AbstractGeometryTrait`: This function should return the `GeoInterface` trait that the correction is intended to be applied to, like `PointTrait` or `LineStringTrait` or `PolygonTrait`.
    * `(::GeometryCorrection)(::AbstractGeometryTrait, geometry)::(some_geometry)`: This function should apply the correction to the given geometry, and return a new geometry.
