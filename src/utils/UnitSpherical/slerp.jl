# Slerp (spherical linear interpolation)

```@docs; canonical=false
slerp
```

Slerp is a spherical interpolation method that is used to interpolate between two points on a unit sphere.
It is a generalization of linear interpolation to the sphere.

The algorithm takes two spherical points and a parameter, `i01`, that is a number between 0 and 1.
The algorithm returns a point on the unit sphere that is a linear interpolation between the two points.

The way this works, is that it basically takes the great circle path between the two points and then
interpolates along that path.

"""
    slerp(a::UnitSphericalPoint, b::UnitSphericalPoint, i01::Number)

Interpolate between `a` and `b`, at a proportion `i01` 
between 0 and 1 along the path from `a` to `b`.

## Examples
