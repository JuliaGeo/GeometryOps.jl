## What is this thing?

The `robust_cross_product` function computes a robust version of the cross product between two unit vectors on a sphere. 
This function is essential for geometric algorithms on the sphere that need stability even when points are very close 
together or nearly antipodal.

Standard cross product calculations can lead to numerical instability when:
- Two points are nearly identical (resulting in a very small cross product)
- Two points are nearly antipodal (making the direction of the cross product unstable)

This implementation handles these edge cases by:
1. Trying a regular cross product first
2. Checking if the result is too small for reliable normalization
3. Using specialized methods to ensure a stable perpendicular vector is returned

## Examples

```@example robust-cross
using GeometryOps.UnitSpherical

# Regular case - points at right angles
a = UnitSphericalPoint(1, 0, 0)
b = UnitSphericalPoint(0, 1, 0)
result = robust_cross_product(a, b)
println("Standard case: ", result)

# Nearly identical points
c = UnitSphericalPoint(1, 1e-10, 0)
result_similar = robust_cross_product(a, c)
println("Nearly identical points: ", result_similar)

# Check that result is perpendicular to both inputs
dot_a = result_similar ⋅ a
dot_c = result_similar ⋅ c
println("Perpendicular to inputs: ", isapprox(dot_a, 0, atol=1e-14), ", ", isapprox(dot_c, 0, atol=1e-14))
```

    robust_cross_product(a::AbstractVector, b::AbstractVector)

Compute a robust version of `a × b` (cross product) for unit vectors.

This method handles the case where `a` and `b` are very close together or
antipodal by computing a stable perpendicular to both points. 

The implementation follows Google's S2 Geometry Library to ensure numerical
stability even in difficult cases.

Returns a unit-length vector that is perpendicular to both input vectors.

# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR S2 EDGE CROSSINGS FUNCTIONALITY

Based on analyzing s2edge_crossings.cc, we need to implement the following components:

## 1. Complete the robust cross product implementation
- [x] Basic RobustCrossProd function ✓
- [x] GetStableCrossProd implementation ✓
- [x] ExactCrossProd for arbitrary-precision arithmetic ✓
  - This uses BigFloat for arbitrary precision vectors
  - Implementing the IsZero function for exact vectors
- [x] SymbolicCrossProd for handling symbolic perturbations ✓
  - This includes lexicographic comparison for points
  - Implemented both SymbolicCrossProdSorted and SymbolicCrossProd
- [x] Add IsUnitLength, IsNormalizable, and EnsureNormalizable functions ✓
- [x] Add NormalizableFromExact conversion ✓

## 2. Edge crossing detection
- [ ] CrossingSign function to determine if two edges cross
  - This is the core function that uses S2EdgeCrosser
- [ ] VertexCrossing for when two edges share a vertex
- [ ] SignedVertexCrossing to determine the sign of a vertex crossing
- [ ] EdgeOrVertexCrossing to handle both cases

## 3. Intersection point calculation
- [ ] GetIntersection function to compute the intersection of two edges
- [ ] Support functions for intersection:
  - [ ] GetIntersectionSimple for simple intersections
  - [ ] GetIntersectionStable for more robust intersections
  - [ ] GetIntersectionExact for arbitrary precision
  - [ ] Helper functions like IsNormalizable, EnsureNormalizable
  - [ ] Functions for vector projection and normalization

## 4. Error estimation and auxiliary functions
- [ ] Error constants like kIntersectionError
- [ ] Functions for checking if a point lies on an edge (ApproximatelyOrdered)
- [ ] RobustNormalWithLength for computing normals with length estimation

## 5. Structure the implementation into modules
- [ ] Move edge crossing functionality to a separate EdgeCrossings module
- [ ] Move edge intersection calculation to an appropriate module
- [ ] Keep the core RobustCrossProd implementation here

## 6. Implementation strategy
1. Start by completing the RobustCrossProd implementation with ExactCrossProd
2. Implement CrossingSign and the basic S2EdgeCrosser functionality
3. Add the intersection point calculation
4. Add the remaining auxiliary and symbolic computation functions
5. Write comprehensive tests for each component

## 7. Dependencies and utilities needed
- A module for arbitrary precision arithmetic (we already have that in BigFloat)
- Symbolic perturbation utilities
- Robust predicates for orientation tests (we already have that through ExactPredicates.jl and AdaptivePredicates.jl)
- Specialized vector types and operations (we already have that in UnitSpherical.jl)
