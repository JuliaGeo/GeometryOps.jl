Generate a random polygon given a center point, number of vertices, and measures
of the polygon's irregularity.
Inputs:
    x               <Real> x-coordinate for center point
    y               <Real> y-coordinate for center point
    nverts          <Int> number of vertices
    avg_radius      <Real> average radius for each point to center point
    irregularity    <Real> measure of randomness for difference in angle between
                        points (between 0 and 1)
    spikiness       <Real> measure of randomness for difference in radius
                        between points (between 0 and 1)
    rng             <RNG> random number generator for polygon creation
Output:
    Vector{Vector{Vector{T}}} representing polygon coordinates
Note:
    Check your outputs! No guarentee that the polygon's aren't self-intersecting
